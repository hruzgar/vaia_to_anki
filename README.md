Inspired by [Florian (reddit comment)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/192w05g/comment/ki5brru/).

I basically adjusted the script from the reddit comment linked above so it doesn't remove the html elements. But adds them in a single line instead, which works perfectly.

**So if you have cards with bullet points, lists etc this script is exactely for that.**

Keep in mind to toggle "Allot HTML in fields" when you're importing the deck.
